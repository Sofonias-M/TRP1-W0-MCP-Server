Activities regarding when setting up a MCP server from TenX
1. I started the challenge from the "Tenx MCP Analysis & IDE Connection Guide" file.
2. After setting up the MCP server with vscode successfully, I continued to setting up cursor from installation to configuration without knowing only one IDE was required as a result wasting time.
3. Proceeded to MCP setup challenge - First challenge file
4. Troubleshot Git connection issues and successfully connected the local repo to GitHub.
