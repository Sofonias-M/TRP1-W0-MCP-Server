[Add, remove, or move suggestions below. These do not affect your current rules.]

- Consider specifying preferred code formatting (e.g., 2 spaces vs 4 spaces, snake_case vs camelCase).
- If you want more/less explanation in responses, clarify with a rule (e.g., "always provide a summary" or "no extra explanation").
- You can restrict use of certain libraries or require only standard library code.
- If you want code comments in a specific style, add a rule for that.
- For security, you may add rules about handling sensitive data or output.

# HTML Attribute Formatting & Structuring Suggestions
- Always use double quotes for all attribute values (e.g., width="auto" not width=auto).
- Do not use commas between attributes; separate attributes with spaces only.
- Use relative paths for images and links whenever possible for portability.
- Remove unnecessary commented-out code to keep files clean.
- Add <header> and <footer> sections for better structure in complex pages.
- Use descriptive <title> and <alt> text for SEO and accessibility.
- Maintain consistent indentation (e.g., 4 spaces) for all nested elements.
- Group related content logically and use semantic HTML tags.
